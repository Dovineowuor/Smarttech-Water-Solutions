## Power Hacks - Smart Water Meter and App
Power Hacks is a project aimed at designing and developing an IoT-Enabled Smart Water Meter and accompanying mobile app that will provide users with real-time monitoring, analysis, and management of their water usage. This project is built using Django, JavaScript, and Python, with APIs including OAuth0 and Google Firebase.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have Python 3.x and Django installed on your machine. You will also need to have an OAuth0 and Google Firebase account, as well as the necessary API keys and credentials.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
sh
Copy code
``git clone https://github.com/your-username/power-hacks.git``
Navigate to the project directory:

Copy code
    `cd power-hacks`
Install the required Python packages:

Copy code
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Create a .env file in the project root directory and add your OAuth0 and Firebase API keys:

Copy code
## OAuth0 Credentials
    `CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
    CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
    DOMAIN=your-domain.auth0.com
    API_AUDIENCE=your-audience`

## Firebase Credentials
    `FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
    FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
    FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
    FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
    FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
    FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
    FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
    FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id`
Run the Django development server:

Copy code
``python manage.py runserver``
Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to view the app.
Usage
Once you have the project up and running, you can start using the IoT-Enabled Smart Water Meter and accompanying mobile app to monitor your water usage. The app will provide real-time monitoring, analysis, and management of your water usage, and will also provide recommendations and alerts based on your usage patterns.
